# Recorder

A lightweight, open-source mouse click recorder made in C#.

This is not a beginner friendly project, it requires a little bit of knowledge!

The Mouse Hooking library is not mine, but it's made by [@CooLMinE](https://github.com/CooLMinE), you can find the repository here: [MouseHookLib](https://github.com/CooLMinE/MouseHookLib).
